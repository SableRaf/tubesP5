# tubesP5 : procedurally drawing tubes over curves

This is a bunch of processing.org classes for drawing tube meshes over a collection of points (a line strip, or a curve).

It implements Parallel Transport Approach to Curve Framing, references could be found in paper from Hui Ma,1995 and in Game Programming Gems 2 volume:
